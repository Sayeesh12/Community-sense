## Resume Bullets (Copy-Ready)

### Option 1: Comprehensive
Built a full-stack MERN application (CivicSolve) enabling citizens to report and track civic issues with geolocation, image uploads, and real-time notifications using React (Vite), Node.js (Express), MongoDB, and Socket.io. Implemented role-based access control (user/authority/admin), complaint lifecycle management, and status history logging to streamline municipal response workflows. Designed a responsive, accessible UI with TailwindCSS and interactive maps (Leaflet), plus heatmap analytics and clustering for spatial insights. Engineered backend with JWT authentication, secure file uploads, geospatial queries (2dsphere), pagination, and admin analytics; containerized the app with Docker and provided CI skeleton. Added seed scripts, unit/integration tests (Jest + Supertest), and frontend tests (Vitest + RTL), improving reliability and demo readiness.

### Option 2: Concise
Developed CivicSolve, a MERN stack community issue reporting platform featuring real-time notifications (Socket.io), geospatial queries, role-based access control, and interactive map visualization. Implemented JWT authentication, secure file uploads, complaint lifecycle management, and admin analytics dashboard. Containerized with Docker, included comprehensive test coverage (Jest, Vitest), and seed scripts for demo data.

### Option 3: Bullet Points
* Built full-stack MERN application (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB) for community issue reporting with real-time updates via Socket.io
* Implemented role-based access control (user/authority/admin) with JWT authentication and secure password hashing (bcrypt)
* Developed geospatial query system using MongoDB 2dsphere indexes for location-based issue discovery and filtering
* Created responsive UI with TailwindCSS, interactive maps (Leaflet), and accessible components (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
* Engineered RESTful API with Express, including image upload (multer), pagination, filtering, and admin analytics endpoints
* Integrated real-time notifications for issue status changes, comments, and upvotes using Socket.io
* Containerized application with Docker and docker-compose for easy deployment and development
* Wrote comprehensive test suites using Jest + Supertest (backend) and Vitest + React Testing Library (frontend)
* Implemented seed scripts for demo data and provided CI/CD skeleton with GitHub Actions

### Option 4: Feature-Focused
* **Real-time Collaboration:** Implemented Socket.io for live updates on issue status changes, comments, and upvotes
* **Geospatial Features:** Built location-based issue discovery using MongoDB geospatial queries and Leaflet map integration
* **Role-Based Workflows:** Designed multi-role system (user/authority/admin) with protected routes and permission-based UI
* **File Management:** Integrated secure image upload with multer, validation, and optional Cloudinary cloud storage
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Created admin dashboard with aggregated statistics, category breakdowns, and heatmap data visualization
* **Testing & Quality:** Achieved comprehensive test coverage with unit tests (Jest), integration tests (Supertest), and component tests (Vitest + RTL)

### Option 5: Technical Deep-Dive
* Architected RESTful API with Express.js featuring JWT-based authentication, request validation (express-validator), error handling middleware, and rate limiting
* Designed MongoDB schemas with Mongoose, implementing geospatial 2dsphere indexes for efficient location queries and compound indexes for common query patterns
* Built React frontend with Vite, implementing state management via React Query for server state and Context API for authentication
* Integrated Socket.io for bidirectional real-time communication, emitting events for issue lifecycle changes and user notifications
* Implemented secure file upload system with multer, including MIME type validation, file size limits, and local storage with optional Cloudinary integration
* Created responsive, accessible UI components with TailwindCSS, ensuring WCAG compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
* Containerized application using multi-stage Docker builds and docker-compose for orchestration, enabling consistent development and deployment environments
* Developed comprehensive test suites: backend integration tests with Jest + Supertest + mongodb-memory-server, frontend component tests with Vitest + React Testing Library
